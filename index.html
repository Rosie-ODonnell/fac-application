            <p id="about-me-title" class="english">about me</p>
            <p class="english" id="about-me-intro"> I'm a self-taught developer, and I'm applying to Founders and Coders to turn my dream of becoming a professional programmer into a reality! <br><br> I'm 9 months in to my coding journey and I love it. In fact, I’d go so far to say I’m obsessed, which I think is a pretty cool way to start a career! <br><br> Currently, I work as a caseworker for a homeless charity but I'm switching into a career that will get my brain buzzing more, challenge me in new ways and allow me to make the best contribution to society that I can. <br><br> I've worked in the third sector for the last three years, first working for a charity trying to make the finance system fairer, and now for a homeless charity. I've been volunteering with the homeless charity sector for the last 8 years. Now, I want to make a broader impact, and pursue a career which will combine my technical and 'soft' skills and challenge me on all levels. <br> <br> But a woman is more than her work, so before I tell you why I'd love to be part of your Spring 2021 cohort, I'd like to take a moment to tell you a little bit more about me and some others things I'm passionate about...</p>

        <div id="why-fac">
            <p id="why-fac-title" class="english">why programming?<br> why fac?</p>
            <div id="why-programming">
            <p class="english">Technology is exciting! And with the speed its changing the world at, I want to be one of the driving forces.</p>
            <p class="english">Programming has the potential to be used for so much good, and as low-code and no-code software increases in popularity, I want to be ahead of the curve so that I can work on more complex coding to create systems and products that make people’s lives better.</p>
            <p class="english">The prospect of life-long learning is also a big draw to the career. I love the creativity of coding and the constant challenges it brings - I thrive off that feeling after hours coding when my brain is groggy and I can’t continue: the only thing I want to do is go to bed and wake up clear-headed to continue.</p>
            <p class="english">I also like the flexibility and opportunities that being a developer offers. There’s not a medium or industry I can think of that doesn’t require technology in some form, which offers developers a unique route to moving between industries whilst constantly developing your skills.</p> 
            <p class="english">With programming, there is always more to build and more to learn. And there is also caution to be had. It’s important to look critically at the rate at which technology reshapes industries and the impact this has. I often wonder if enough people working in tech are constructively critical of its own powers; I think more people should be.  I would love to work in technology because it equally amazes and terrifies me.</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="english" class="heart"> I have teaching experience, which I know from my coding journey so far is a valuable skill. New learners are the best teachers for other new learners, and I also have the patience required...</li>
                <li class="english" class="heart"> Problem-solving: my current work requires me to problem solve on the spot, and work with new cases every day.  </li>
                <li class="english" class="heart"> I'm a team player! I love learning as part of group and work hard to bring others up with me as I progress. Also passion and determination. When I put my mind to something I do it, and I take others with me. Give example of helping my friend learn Spanish and doing language exchanges. Also, lots to improve! And a hunger to learn more!</li>
