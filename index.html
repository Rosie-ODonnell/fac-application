            <p>Technology is exciting! And with the speed its changing the world at, I want to be one of the driving forces.</p>
            <p>Programming has the potential to be used for so much good, and as low-code and no-code software increases in popularity, I want to be ahead of the curve so that I can work on more complex coding to create systems and products that make people’s lives better.</p>
            <p>The prospect of life-long learning is also a big draw to the career. I love the creativity of coding and the constant challenges it brings - I thrive off that feeling after hours coding when my brain is groggy and I can’t continue: the only thing I want to do is go to bed and wake up clear-headed to continue.</p>
            <p>I also like the flexibility and opportunities that being a developer offers. There’s not a medium or industry I can think of that doesn’t require technology in some form, which offers developers a unique route to moving between industries whilst constantly developing your skills.</p> 
            <p>With programming, there is always more to build and more to learn. And there is also caution to be had. It’s important to look critically at the rate at which technology reshapes industries and the impact this has. I often wonder if enough people working in tech are constructively critical of its own powers; I think more people should be.  I would love to work in technology because it equally amazes and terrifies me.</p>
